 * Options:
 * reconnection whether to reconnect automatically (true)
 * reconnectionAttempts (Infinity) before giving up
 * reconnectionDelay how long to initially wait before attempting a new reconnection (1000). Affected by +/- randomizationFactor, for example the default initial delay will be between 500 to 1500ms.
 * reconnectionDelayMax maximum amount of time to wait between reconnections (5000). Each attempt increases the reconnection delay by 2x along with a randomization as above
 * randomizationFactor(0.5`), 0 <= randomizationFactor <= 1
 * timeout connection timeout before a connect_error and connect_timeout events are emitted (20000)
 * autoConnect by setting this false, you have to call manager.open whenever you decide it's appropriate
